    description: "I worked independently on a Navigation System that required me to implement Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, data parsing, and the in and out pipe communication to the pygame plotter. I created a C++ class called digraph.cpp and implemented Dijkstra's algorithm to determine the least cost path between two vertices. Through my implementation of unordered maps and a min heap, my algorithm achieved an efficient time complexity.",

We successfully simulated 3D elastic collisions between hundreds of particles and reacted to form a new particle utilizing Three.js. In addition, we added macroscopic properties such as temperature which can affect the velocity of each particle and the reaction speed.",
